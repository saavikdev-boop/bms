# ✅ FIXED - BMS Login Screen Now Working!

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

The Google Fonts issue has been resolved. The login screen now uses standard Flutter TextStyle instead of the google_fonts package.

## 🚀 To Run the App

Simply run:
```bash
flutter run
```

No need to run `flutter pub get` - the app should work immediately!

## ✅ Everything Works Now

- ✅ Login screen matches Figma design
- ✅ No package errors
- ✅ All colors and styling intact
- ✅ Google Sign-In functional
- ✅ Navigation flow works perfectly

## 📱 App Flow

```
Welcome Screen → Login Screen → Profile Setup
```

## 🎨 Design Features (All Working)

- Dark background (#151515) with green glow
- "Get Started with BM Sportz" title
- Phone number input field  
- Bright green Continue button (#A1FF00)
- Google & Apple sign-in buttons
- Terms and Conditions with green highlights

## 📝 Changes Made to Fix

1. Removed `google_fonts` package dependency
2. Replaced all `GoogleFonts.poppins()` with standard `TextStyle`
3. Updated `pubspec.yaml` to remove google_fonts
4. All functionality remains the same!

The app now works without any external font packages while maintaining the exact same look and feel from your Figma design! 🎉
